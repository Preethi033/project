<h3>Pasta</h3>
<p> First favorite is Pasta, I like it lot that I would eat it everyday if I can. I love the Italian cuisine so much. I just like the way it is cheesy and the sauce each pasta is made out of. My favorite type of pasta is spaghetti and Penne. I would prefer the red sauce pasta more than white sauce since it has more taste to it.
</p>
<li><h3>Noodles</li></h3>
<p> My second favorite is Noodles becasue it is really yummy and tasty. Noodles is really fast to make and eat. I like to eat noodles for lunch often. There are many types of noodles that i want to try. Ever since i tried noodles for the first time i really liked it alot.
