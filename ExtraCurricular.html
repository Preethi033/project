<h3>Sports and music</h3>

<p> I like to go for a walk around my neighborhood with my friend. I also like playing badminton with my friend. I have played basketball when I was in fourth grade. I played baseball when I was in fifth grade in my school. I played the violin from 6th grade to 11th grade. 

<h3>Volunteering</h3>

<p>I had to get volunteering hours for school so when I was looking to get volunteer hours easily. Then my parents told me that I should volunteer at the library. I thought that was a good idea since I like going to library. So, ever since then I volunteer at the library every weekend and help with programs at the library. I really love volunteering at the library and working with the library workers.
